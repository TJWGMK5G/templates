                Your information also allows us to personalize your workouts and
                provide tailored fitness plans that align with your goals.

                personal information from unauthorized access, disclosure, or
                misuse. Our facilities are equipped with advanced technology to
                safeguard your data during transmission and storage. Only
                authorized personnel have access to your personal information,
                and they are required to maintain its confidentiality. We
