                AuraDesign employs industry-standard security measures to
                protect the confidentiality and integrity of your personal
                information. We use encryption, firewalls, and secure socket
                layer technology (SSL) to safeguard your data during
                transmission. Access to your personal information is restricted
                to authorized personnel who need to know the information to
                perform their job duties. We regularly review and update our
                security practices to protect against unauthorized access,
                alteration, disclosure, or destruction of your personal
                information. Despite our efforts to protect your information, no
                method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage
                is completely secure. Therefore, while we strive to use
                commercially acceptable means to protect your personal
                information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. It is
                important to keep your account credentials confidential and to
                log out of your account when using shared or public computers to
                prevent unauthorized access to your information. If you believe
                that your personal information has been compromised or if you
                have any concerns about the security of your data, please
                contact us immediately.

                AuraDesign may share your personal information with third-party
                service providers who assist us in operating our website,

                information only for the purposes of providing services to us
                and are prohibited from disclosing or using your information for

                to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet
                national security or law enforcement requirements. In the event
                that AuraDesign undergoes a business transaction, such as a
                merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, your personal
                information may be transferred as part of the transaction. We
                will notify you via email and/or a prominent notice on our
                website of any change in ownership or uses of your personal
                information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your

                policy, unless a longer retention period is required or
                permitted by law. We will retain and use your information as
                necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve
                disputes, and enforce our agreements. If you wish to request the

                destroy or anonymize your personal information once it is no
                longer needed for the purposes for which it was collected.

                any of these rights, please contact us using the information
                provided at the end of this policy. We will respond to your

                steps to delete that information. Parents or legal guardians who
