                Data Security Measures: Protecting the security of our
                customers' personal information is a top priority at OfficeEase.
                We implement a variety of security measures to safeguard against
                unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction of
                personal data. These measures include encryption, firewalls,
                secure socket layer (SSL) technology, and regular security
                audits. We also restrict access to personal information to
                authorized employees and contractors who need to know the
                information to perform their duties.
