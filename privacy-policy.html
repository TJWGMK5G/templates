                Data Protection: SkylineRealty employs industry-standard
                security measures to protect users' personal information against
                unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. We
                use secure socket layer (SSL) encryption to safeguard sensitive

                authorized personnel who require the information to perform
                their duties. Despite our best efforts, no method of
                transmission over the internet or electronic storage is
                completely secure, and SkylineRealty cannot guarantee absolute
                security of users' information. In the event of a data breach,
                affected users will be notified promptly in accordance with
                applicable laws and regulations.
