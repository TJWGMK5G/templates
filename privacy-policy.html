            protection laws. These rights may include the right to access,

          <h3>International Data Transfers:</h3>

          <p>
            As a global Fantasy Cricket platform, we may need to transfer your

          </p>

          <h3>Data Minimization:</h3>

          <p>
            We adhere to the principle of data minimization, whereby we only
            collect and process personal information that is necessary for the
            fulfillment of specific purposes. We limit the scope of data
            collection to relevant and proportionate categories, thereby
            reducing the risk of excessive or unnecessary processing.
            Additionally, we periodically review and update our data retention
            practices to dispose of information that is no longer required for
            the intended purposes.
