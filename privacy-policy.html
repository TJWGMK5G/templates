                cookies and similar technologies to enhance your browsing
                experience and analyze website traffic. These technologies help

                voluntarily, such as your musical interests or feedback on our
                courses. Providing this information is optional but helps us
                tailor our services to better meet your needs. We do not
                knowingly collect personal information from children under the
                age of 13 without parental consent. If we learn that we have

                We use the information we collect to personalize your learning
                experience on VirtuosoVibes, including recommending courses and
                content that may interest you based on your preferences. Your
                personal information enables us to process transactions, provide
                customer support, and communicate with you about our services,
                promotions, and updates. We may use aggregated data for
                analytical purposes to understand trends and improve our
                platform. Aggregated data does not personally identify you and
                is used in a manner consistent with this privacy policy. If you

                remain in our archives where deletion is not feasible. We may
                also retain non-personal information indefinitely for analytical
                purposes.
