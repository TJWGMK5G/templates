                We collect personal data that you provide directly to us, such
                as when you fill out contact forms, request property listings,
                or communicate with our team. This information may include your
                name, email address, phone number, and property preferences. We
                may also collect information automatically, such as your IP

                website. All data is collected in compliance with relevant laws
                and regulations. We ensure that only necessary information is

                The personal information we collect is used to provide, improve,
                and customize our real estate services. This may include
                responding to inquiries, providing property listings, and
                processing transactions. We also use your information to enhance
                your user experience on our website by tailoring content to your
                interests. Additionally, we may use your data for internal
                purposes, such as analyzing website traffic and improving our
                services. Your information will not be shared for any purposes
                beyond what is outlined in this policy.
              </li>
              <li>
                We process personal data based on several legal grounds. First,
                we process your data when it is necessary for the performance of
                a contract, such as when you engage with us for real estate
                services. We also process data based on legitimate interests,
                such as improving our website and marketing efforts. Consent is
                obtained for certain types of data processing, such as sending
                promotional emails. Lastly, we may process data to comply with
                legal obligations or regulatory requirements. These legal bases
                ensure that your data is handled appropriately.
              </li>

                We retain your personal information only for as long as
                necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this policy. This
                means we will keep your data for as long as you remain a client
                of NextMoveEstates or as required by law. When your information
                is no longer needed, we will securely delete or anonymize it. We
                regularly review our data retention practices to ensure
                compliance with current regulations. You may request the
                deletion of your data at any time, subject to legal obligations.

                We take data security seriously and implement a variety of
                measures to protect your personal information. These measures
                include encryption, firewalls, and access controls to prevent
                unauthorized access to your data. While we strive to safeguard
                your information, no system can be completely secure, and we
                cannot guarantee absolute security. In the event of a data
                breach, we will notify affected individuals as required by law.
                We continuously review and update our security practices to
                adapt to new threats and technologies.

                NextMoveEstates may transfer your personal information to
                servers located outside of your country of residence. These
                transfers are necessary to provide our services and may involve

                appropriate measures to ensure that any international data
                transfers comply with applicable legal requirements. This
                includes using standard contractual clauses and ensuring that
                third-party providers adhere to strict data protection
                standards. By using our services, you consent to the transfer of
