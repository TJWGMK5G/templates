                administering the site, tracking user movements, and gathering
                demographic information. We may also use your information to
                send you promotional emails or newsletters, but you have the
                option to opt out of receiving such communications. Your
                information will not be sold, exchanged, transferred, or given

                Our website and services are not directed to children under the
                age of 18. We do not knowingly collect personal information from
                children under the age of 18 without verifiable parental
                consent. If we discover that a child under 18 has provided us
                with personal information without parental consent, we will
                promptly delete such information from our systems. Parents or
                guardians who believe that their child has provided us with
                personal information without their consent should contact us
                immediately.

                We reserve the right to update or modify this privacy policy at
                any time without prior notice. Any changes to this policy will
                be posted on this page with an updated revision date. We
                encourage you to review this privacy policy periodically to stay
                informed about how we are protecting your information. Your
                continued use of our website or services after the posting of
                changes constitutes your acceptance of those changes. If you do
                not agree with any aspect of the updated privacy policy, you
                must immediately cease using our website and services.

                You have the option to opt out of receiving promotional

                promotional emails or newsletters, you can unsubscribe by
                following the instructions provided in the email or by
                contacting us directly. Even if you opt out of receiving

                non-promotional messages related to your transactions or
                account. Please allow up to 10 business days for us to process
                your opt-out request. Opting out of promotional communications
                does not opt you out of necessary communications, such as those
                regarding your reservations or account.

                please contact us using the information provided at the end of

                still be stored in backup copies for a limited period of time
                due to technical constraints. We may also retain certain
                information for record-keeping purposes, to resolve disputes,
                enforce our agreements, or comply with legal obligations. Your
                personal information will be securely disposed of when it is no
                longer needed for these purposes.
