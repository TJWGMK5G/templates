                CAA is dedicated to protecting the privacy of children and does
                not knowingly collect personal information from individuals
                under the age of 18 without parental consent. If we become aware
                that we have inadvertently collected such information, we will
                take immediate steps to delete it from our records. Our services
                are intended for adults and those who have attained the legal
                age to engage in pilot training programs. We encourage parents
                and guardians to monitor their children's online activities and
                educate them about safe internet practices. Any data collected
                with parental consent is handled with the same level of security
                and care as all other personal information.

                all requests promptly and ensure that any updates are made in a
                timely manner. You also have the right to withdraw consent for
                the use of your personal data, subject to legal and contractual

                CAA retains your personal information only for as long as
                necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected,
                including any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements. Once

                anonymize it, ensuring that it cannot be reconstructed or used
                in any way. We periodically review our data retention practices
                to ensure compliance with applicable laws and to adapt to new
                regulations. By retaining your data only as long as needed, we
                minimize the risk of unauthorized access or misuse. This
                approach reflects our commitment to responsible data management.

                CAA may transfer your personal information to countries other

                we take steps to ensure that your privacy rights continue to be
                protected. All international data transfers are carried out in
                compliance with applicable data protection laws, and we use
                standard contractual clauses or other legal mechanisms to
                safeguard your information. By using our services, you consent
                to the transfer of your data to countries outside of your
                residence. We remain committed to protecting your data
                regardless of where it is processed.
