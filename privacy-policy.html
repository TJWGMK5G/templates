                accessible by authorized personnel who have special access
                rights to such systems. All financial transactions are processed

                its service provider transfers to your computer's hard drive
                through your web browser (if you allow) that enables the site's

                understand and save your preferences for future visits, keep
                track of advertisements and compile aggregate data about site
                traffic and site interaction so that we can offer better site
                experiences and tools in the future.

                information from children under the age of 18 without parental
                consent. If we learn that we have collected personal information
                from a child under the age of 18 without parental consent, we
                will take steps to delete such information as soon as possible.
                Parents or guardians who believe that GamingGenius may have
                collected personal information from a child under the age of 18
                without consent can contact us to request the deletion of that
                information.

                residents have the right to request information regarding the
                disclosure of their personal information to third parties for
                direct marketing purposes. GamingGenius does not engage in such
                disclosures. California residents may request a copy of the
                information we have collected about them, as well as information
                about the categories of third parties with whom we have shared
                their personal information for direct marketing purposes, if
                any.

                posting of changes to this Privacy Policy will be deemed your

                You can access and update your personal information by logging
                into your account on GamingGenius. You may also contact us to
                request access to or correction of any personal information we
                have about you. We may decline requests that are unreasonably
                repetitive, require disproportionate technical effort,
                jeopardize the privacy of others, or are impractical. To protect
                your privacy and security, we may verify your identity before
                granting access to your personal information. We will respond to
                your request within a reasonable timeframe.
              </li>
              <li>
                We retain your personal information for as long as necessary to
                fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy unless a
                longer retention period is required or permitted by law. We may
                retain non-personal information indefinitely. If you close your
                account or request that we delete your information, we may
                retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our
                legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.
                We will securely delete or anonymize your personal information
                when it is no longer needed for the purposes for which it was
                collected. We may retain aggregated or anonymized data
                indefinitely for analytical purposes.
