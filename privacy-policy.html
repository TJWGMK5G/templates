                We retain your personal information only for as long as
                necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy
                Policy. The retention period may vary depending on the type of

                we will securely delete or anonymize it. We regularly review our
                data retention practices to ensure that we are not holding onto
                your information longer than necessary.
