                partners to facilitate transactions, such as payment processors
                and shipping companies. These third parties are obligated to
                keep your information secure and use it solely for the purpose
                of providing their services. We may also disclose your
                information if required by law, or in response to a valid

                At Dazzle & Shine, we take data security seriously and implement
                a variety of measures to protect your personal information. We
                utilize industry-standard encryption techniques to safeguard
