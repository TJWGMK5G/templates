                keep your information secure and use it solely for the purpose
                of providing their services. We may also disclose your
                information if required by law, or in response to a valid

                At Dazzle & Shine, we take data security seriously and implement
                a variety of measures to protect your personal information. We
                utilize industry-standard encryption techniques to safeguard
