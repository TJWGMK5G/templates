                adjusting their communication preferences in their account
                settings or clicking the "unsubscribe" link in promotional
                emails. However, please note that certain account-related

                information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes
                outlined in this privacy policy, unless a longer retention
                period is required or permitted by law. We regularly review and
                update our data retention practices to ensure compliance with
                legal requirements and industry standards. We implement
                appropriate technical, organizational, and administrative

                Children's Privacy: FantasyCrease is not intended for use by
                children under the age of 18 without parental consent. We do not
                knowingly collect personal information from children under the
                age of 18 without parental consent. If we become aware that we
                have inadvertently collected personal information from a child
                under the age of 18 without parental consent, we will take steps
                to delete the information as soon as possible. Parents or legal
                guardians who believe that their child has provided personal
                information to FantasyCrease without their consent can contact
                us to request the removal of the information and opt out of
                future collection. We encourage parents and guardians to monitor

                to ensure their privacy and safety.

                residence, including those that require data protection measures
                equivalent to those in the user's country of residence. By using

                Data Minimization Principle: FantasyCrease adheres to the

                of personal data we collect to what is relevant, adequate, and
                not excessive for the intended purpose. By minimizing data
                collection, we reduce the risk of unauthorized access, misuse,
                or disclosure of user information.

                otherwise permitted by law. Users have the right to withdraw
                their consent at any time by adjusting their account settings or
                contacting our support team. Additionally, users can choose to
                delete their account and personal information permanently.
