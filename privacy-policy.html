                not sell or rent your information to third parties for marketing
                purposes. Your privacy is our priority.

                PartyBliss does not knowingly collect personal information from
                children under the age of 18. If we become aware that we have
                collected such information, we will take steps to delete it
                promptly. We encourage parents and guardians to monitor their
                children’s online activities and ensure that they do not provide
                personal information without permission. Protecting children’s
                privacy is important to us.
