                By using OfficeNest’s services or website, you agree to comply
                with the terms and conditions outlined here. These terms apply
                to all users, including those browsing for information and those
                engaging in office rentals. Your continued use of our platform
                indicates acceptance of these terms. If you do not agree, you
                must discontinue your use of the site immediately. OfficeNest
                reserves the right to modify these terms at any time without
                prior notice.
              </h1>
              <h2 class="main-terms__h2">
                All office space rentals with OfficeNest require a signed rental
                agreement. The agreement will outline the terms of your lease,
                including the duration, payment schedules, and additional
                conditions. It is essential that you thoroughly review your
                agreement before signing. Once signed, the contract becomes
                legally binding, and both parties must adhere to its terms. Any
                disputes arising from the rental agreement will be handled as
                per the resolution methods stated within.
              </h2>
              <li>
                Payments for office rentals are due according to the schedule
                outlined in your agreement. OfficeNest accepts various payment
                methods, including credit card, bank transfer, and online
                payment portals. All payments must be made in full and on time
                to avoid late fees or termination of services. If you encounter
                any issues with payment, please contact us immediately to
                discuss options. We reserve the right to charge late fees or
                take legal action if payments are not received within the
                agreed-upon timeframe.
              </li>
              <li>
                Clients may cancel their office rental agreements under specific
                conditions, as outlined in their contracts. OfficeNest offers a
                partial refund for cancellations made before the rental period
                begins. Refunds will not be provided once the rental period has
                started unless otherwise stated in your agreement. We advise all
                clients to review the cancellation terms carefully to avoid
                misunderstandings. If you wish to cancel, please provide written
                notice to our support team.
              </li>
              <li>
                OfficeNest spaces are intended for business-related activities
                only. Clients are prohibited from using the rental offices for
                unlawful purposes or activities that may disrupt other tenants.
                The rental agreement outlines the permitted use of the space,
                and any violation may result in immediate termination of the
                lease. You are responsible for ensuring that your business
                activities comply with local laws and regulations. Any damages
                caused by misuse of the space will be the client’s
                responsibility.
              </li>
              <li>
                OfficeNest is responsible for the general maintenance of all
                rental spaces. If any repairs are needed during your lease,
                please notify us immediately so that we can address the issue
                promptly. We strive to maintain all spaces in excellent
                condition and conduct regular inspections. However, clients are
                responsible for maintaining the cleanliness and order of their
                rented office. Any damages caused by the tenant or their
                employees must be repaired at the tenant’s expense.
              </li>
              <li>
                OfficeNest recommends that all clients obtain business insurance
                covering their office use. While we maintain insurance for the
                building and common areas, it is the client’s responsibility to
                insure their own equipment, furniture, and other assets. Without
                proper insurance, OfficeNest cannot be held liable for damages
                or losses to personal property. Please consult with an insurance
                provider to ensure you have adequate coverage during your lease.
              </li>
              <li>
                A security deposit is required for all office rentals with
                OfficeNest. This deposit will be held for the duration of the
                lease and may be used to cover damages, unpaid rent, or other
                costs incurred during the tenancy. At the end of the lease, the
                deposit will be returned to the client, minus any deductions for
                repairs or outstanding balances. The amount of the deposit and
                conditions for its return are outlined in the rental agreement.

              </li>
              <li>
                Clients may not make any permanent modifications to their rental
                spaces without prior written consent from OfficeNest. This
                includes but is not limited to structural changes, painting, and
                installing permanent fixtures. If you wish to make temporary
                adjustments, such as adding furniture or decor, please discuss
                this with us beforehand. Unauthorized modifications may result
                in charges to restore the office to its original condition upon
                the termination of the lease.
              </li>
              <li>
                OfficeNest provides internet access and communication services
                as part of our office rental offerings. However, the
                availability and speed of these services may vary depending on
                the location and the specific terms of your rental agreement.
                Clients are responsible for ensuring that their use of the
                internet complies with applicable laws and does not disrupt the
                services of other tenants. Any misuse of communication services
                may result in suspension or additional charges.
              </li>
              <li>
                OfficeNest reserves the right to terminate rental agreements
                under specific circumstances, including non-payment, violation
                of terms, or illegal activities. In the event of termination,
                clients will be given written notice and a specified period to
                vacate the office. Clients may also terminate their leases by
                providing written notice according to the terms outlined in the
                agreement. Any outstanding payments or fees must be settled
                before the lease is officially terminated.
              </li>
              <li>
                Both OfficeNest and the client agree to maintain the
                confidentiality of sensitive information shared during the
                course of business. This includes, but is not limited to, rental
                agreements, business plans, and personal information. OfficeNest
                will take reasonable measures to ensure that your data is
                protected from unauthorized access. Clients are also responsible
                for safeguarding confidential information and ensuring it is not
                disclosed without proper authorization.
