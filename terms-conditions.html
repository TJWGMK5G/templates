                To use PitawGame, you must be at least 18 years old or the legal
                age for gambling in your jurisdiction, whichever is higher. By
                registering and using our services, you confirm that you meet
                this age requirement. We reserve the right to request proof of
                age and suspend your account until satisfactory verification is
                provided. If we discover that you do not meet the age
                requirement, your account will be terminated immediately.
              </h2>
              <li>
                When creating an account, you agree to provide accurate and
                complete information. You are responsible for maintaining the
                confidentiality of your account credentials and for all
                activities that occur under your account. You must notify us
                immediately of any unauthorized use or breach of security. We
                are not liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure
                to comply with this obligation.

                As a user of PitawGame, you agree to use our services lawfully
                and respectfully. You must not engage in any activity that is
                harmful, illegal, or disruptive to other users or our platform.
                This includes cheating, hacking, or using automated tools to
                gain an unfair advantage. We reserve the right to investigate

                Each game offered on PitawGame has specific rules and guidelines
                that you must follow. These rules are available within the game
                interface and on our website. By participating in any game, you
                agree to abide by its rules and accept the outcome determined by
                our systems. Any attempts to manipulate or exploit game
                mechanics will result in penalties, including account suspension
                or termination.

                All financial transactions on PitawGame, including deposits and
                withdrawals, must be made through our approved payment methods.
                You are responsible for providing accurate payment information
                and ensuring sufficient funds for transactions. Withdrawals are
                subject to verification procedures and may take several business
                days to process. We reserve the right to decline or reverse
                transactions if fraudulent activity is suspected.

                PitawGame may offer bonuses, promotions, and special offers to
                users from time to time. These incentives are subject to
                specific terms and conditions, which will be clearly
                communicated. By participating in any promotion, you agree to
                the applicable terms. We reserve the right to modify or cancel
                promotions at any time without prior notice.

                We are committed to promoting responsible gaming and providing a
                safe environment for all users. You are encouraged to set limits
                on your gaming activities and seek help if gambling becomes a
                problem. Resources and support for responsible gaming are
                available on our website. We reserve the right to impose limits
                on accounts and take action if irresponsible gaming behavior is
                detected.

                Your privacy is important to us. Our Privacy Policy explains how

                our services, you consent to our data practices as described in
                the Privacy Policy. We take appropriate measures to secure your
                data but cannot guarantee absolute security. You are responsible
                for maintaining the confidentiality of your account information.

                PitawGame is provided on an "as is" and "as available" basis. We
                do not warrant that our services will be uninterrupted,
                error-free, or secure. To the fullest extent permitted by law,
                we disclaim all warranties and liabilities related to your use
                of our platform. We are not liable for any indirect, incidental,

                You agree to indemnify and hold PitawGame, its affiliates, and
                employees harmless from any claims, liabilities, damages, and
                expenses arising from your use of our services. This includes
                any breach of these Terms and Conditions or violations of
                applicable laws. We reserve the right to assume the exclusive
                defense and control of any matter subject to indemnification by
                you.

                We reserve the right to terminate or suspend your account at our
                discretion, with or without notice, for any violation of these
                Terms and Conditions or other policies. Upon termination, your
                right to use our services will cease immediately. Any funds in
                your account at the time of termination may be forfeited,
                subject to applicable laws.
              </li>
              <li>
                Any disputes arising from these Terms and Conditions or your use
                of PitawGame will be resolved through binding arbitration,
                conducted in accordance with the rules of the relevant
                arbitration body. You agree to waive your right to a court trial
                and participate in arbitration. The arbitration decision will be
                final and binding, and judgment may be entered upon it in any
                court having jurisdiction.
              </li>

              <li>
                These Terms and Conditions are governed by the laws of the
                jurisdiction in which PitawGame operates. Any legal action or
                proceeding arising from these terms will be brought exclusively
                in the courts of that jurisdiction. By using our services, you
                consent to the jurisdiction and venue of these courts and waive
                any objections to such jurisdiction.

              </li>
              <li>
                We may amend these Terms and Conditions from time to time to
                reflect changes in our practices or legal requirements. Any
                changes will be posted on this page, and the revised terms will
                be effective immediately upon posting. We encourage you to
                review these terms periodically to stay informed about your
                rights and obligations. Your continued use of our services
                constitutes acceptance of any changes.
              </li>
              <li>
                By creating an account on PitawGame, you consent to receive
                electronic communications from us, including emails and
                notifications related to your account and transactions. You can
                manage your communication preferences through your account
                settings. We are not responsible for any issues arising from
                your failure to receive communications due to incorrect contact
                information.
              </li>
              <li>
                If any provision of these Terms and Conditions is found to be
                invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions will remain
                in full force and effect. The invalid or unenforceable provision
                will be replaced by a valid, enforceable provision that most
                closely matches the intent of the original provision. This
                ensures that the overall agreement remains effective and
                enforceable.
              </li>
              <li>
                Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms and
                Conditions will not be deemed a waiver of such right or
                provision. Any waiver must be in writing and signed by an
                authorized representative of PitawGame. A waiver of any right or
                provision on one occasion does not imply a waiver on any other
                occasion.
              </li>
              <li>
                These Terms and Conditions constitute the entire agreement
                between you and PitawGame regarding your use of our services.
                They supersede all prior or contemporaneous understandings,
                agreements, and representations. Any additional terms or
                amendments must be agreed upon in writing and signed by both
                parties to be valid.
