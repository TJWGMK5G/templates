              <li>
                To the fullest extent permitted by law, GamingGenius and its
                affiliates, officers, directors, employees, agents, and
                suppliers shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental,
                special, consequential, or punitive damages, including but not
                limited to damages for lost profits, revenue, goodwill, use,
                data, or other intangible losses, arising out of or in
                connection with your use of GamingGenius. In no event shall
                GamingGenius' total liability to you for all claims, damages,
                losses, and causes of action, whether in contract, tort
                (including negligence), or otherwise, exceed the amount paid by
                you, if any, for accessing or using GamingGenius. Some
                jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of
                liability for consequential or incidental damages, so the above
                limitation may not apply to you. You agree that the limitations
                of liability set forth in these terms and conditions are fair
                and reasonable.
              </li>
              <li>
                You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless GamingGenius
                and its affiliates, officers, directors, employees, agents, and
                suppliers from and against any and all claims, liabilities,
                damages, losses, costs, expenses, or fees (including reasonable
                attorneys' fees) arising out of or relating to your use of
                GamingGenius, your violation of these terms and conditions, or
                your violation of any rights of a third party. We reserve the
                right to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter
                otherwise subject to indemnification by you, in which case you
                agree to cooperate with our defense of such claims. This
                indemnification obligation will survive these terms and
                conditions and your use of GamingGenius.
              </li>
              <li>
                Any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating to
                these terms and conditions or your use of GamingGenius shall be
                resolved exclusively by binding arbitration conducted in
                accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration
                Association. The arbitration shall take place in [city, state],
                and the arbitrator's decision shall be final and binding upon
                the parties. You waive any right you may have to participate in
                any class, collective, or representative action or proceeding.
                This arbitration agreement is governed by the Federal
                Arbitration Act. If any provision of this arbitration agreement
                is found to be unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall
                remain in full force and effect.
              </li>
              <li>
                These terms and conditions shall be governed by and construed in
                accordance with the laws of the State, without regard to its
                conflicts of law principles. You agree to submit to the personal
                jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located for any
                actions not subject to arbitration under these terms and
                conditions. The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the
                International Sale of Goods shall not apply to these terms and
                conditions. If any provision of these terms and conditions is
                found to be invalid or unenforceable, such provision shall be
                severed from these terms and conditions, and the remaining
                provisions shall remain in full force and effect. These terms
                and conditions constitute the entire agreement between you and
                GamingGenius regarding your use of GamingGenius and supersede
                all prior or contemporaneous agreements and understandings,
                whether oral or written.
              </li>
              <li>
                No waiver by GamingGenius of any term or condition set forth in
                these terms and conditions shall be deemed a further or
                continuing waiver of such term or condition or a waiver of any
                other term or condition. If any provision of these terms and
                conditions is found to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable,
                the validity, legality, and enforceability of the remaining
                provisions shall not be affected or impaired. You agree that any
                failure by GamingGenius to enforce any right or provision of
                these terms and conditions shall not constitute a waiver of such
                right or provision. The section titles in these terms and
                conditions are for convenience only and have no legal or
                contractual effect. These terms and conditions shall not be
                construed against the drafting party.
