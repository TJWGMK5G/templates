                You agree not to use the RootKitchen website or services for any
                unlawful purpose or in any way that could harm or impair our
                operations. Prohibited conduct includes, but is not limited to,
                using the site to transmit any fraudulent, deceptive, or
                misleading information; interfering with the security or

              </li>
              <li>
                To the fullest extent permitted by law, RootKitchen and its
                affiliates, officers, directors, employees, and agents shall not
                be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential,
                or punitive damages arising out of or related to your use of our
                site or services. This includes, but is not limited to, damages
                for loss of profits, goodwill, use, data, or other intangible
                losses.
              </li>
              <li>
                You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless RootKitchen
                and its affiliates, officers, directors, employees, and agents
                from and against any and all claims, liabilities, damages,
                losses, costs, and expenses, including reasonable attorneys'
                fees, arising out of or related to your use of our site or
                services, your violation of these Terms and Conditions, or your
                violation of any rights of another.
              </li>
              <li>
                RootKitchen reserves the right to terminate or suspend your
                account and access to our site and services at any time, with or
                without cause or notice. Upon termination, your right to use our
                site and services will immediately cease. All provisions of
                these Terms and Conditions that by their nature should survive
                termination shall survive, including ownership provisions,
                warranty disclaimers, indemnity, and limitations of liability.
              </li>
              <li>
                These Terms and Conditions shall be governed by and construed in
                accordance with the laws of the state in which RootKitchen
                operates, without regard to its conflict of law principles. Any
                legal action or proceeding arising out of or related to these
                terms shall be brought exclusively in the federal or state
                courts located in that state.
              </li>
              <li>
                In the event of any dispute or claim arising out of or related
                to these Terms and Conditions, you agree to first attempt to
                resolve the dispute informally by contacting us. If the dispute
                cannot be resolved informally, you agree to resolve any
                remaining disputes through binding arbitration, rather than in
                court, in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration
                Association.
              </li>
              <li>
                If any provision of these Terms and Conditions is found to be
                invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall remain
                in full force and effect. The invalid or unenforceable provision
                shall be deemed modified so that it is valid and enforceable to
                the maximum extent permitted by law. The failure to enforce any
                right or provision of these terms shall not constitute a waiver
                of such right or provision.
              </li>
              <li>
                These Terms and Conditions, along with any policies or operating
                rules posted on our site, constitute the entire agreement and
                understanding between you and RootKitchen. They supersede any
                prior or contemporaneous agreements, communications, and
                proposals, whether oral or written. Any ambiguities in the
                interpretation of these terms shall not be construed against the
                drafting party.
              </li>
              <li>
                RootKitchen shall not be liable for any delay or failure to
                perform resulting from causes outside our reasonable control,
                including but not limited to acts of God, war, terrorism, riots,
                embargoes, acts of civil or military authorities, fire, floods,
                accidents, strikes, or shortages of transportation facilities,
                fuel, energy, labor, or materials.
