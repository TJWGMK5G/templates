                By accessing and using the ExploreHorizon website, you agree to
                comply with and be bound by these Terms and Conditions. Your use
                of our services signifies your understanding and acceptance of
                all terms outlined in this document. If you do not agree with
                any of the terms, you must discontinue use of the website and
                services immediately. ExploreHorizon reserves the right to
                update or modify these terms at any time without prior notice.
                Continued use of the site following changes indicates your
                acceptance of the new terms.

              <h2 class="main-terms__h2">
                When you make a booking through ExploreHorizon, you agree to the
                specific terms and conditions of the travel service providers
                (e.g., airlines, hotels, tour operators). These providers have
                their own policies regarding cancellations, refunds, and other
                aspects of your booking. It is your responsibility to review and
                understand these policies before making a reservation.
                ExploreHorizon is not responsible for any disputes that arise
                from the terms set by third-party providers. Our role is to
                facilitate your bookings, and we act as an intermediary between
                you and the provider.
              </h2>
              <li>
                All payments for travel services must be made through the
                methods specified on the ExploreHorizon website. You are
                responsible for providing accurate payment information and
                ensuring that sufficient funds are available to complete the
                transaction. We reserve the right to cancel any bookings if
                payment is not received in full by the due date. In addition to
                the base price of travel services, you may be responsible for
                additional fees, such as taxes, surcharges, and service fees.
                These fees will be clearly outlined during the booking process.
              </li>
              <li>
                Cancellation policies vary depending on the service provider,
                and it is your responsibility to familiarize yourself with these
                policies before confirming a booking. ExploreHorizon may charge
                a cancellation fee in addition to any fees imposed by the
                provider. Refund eligibility will depend on the specific terms
                of your booking, and certain bookings may be non-refundable. If
                you wish to cancel a booking, you must contact ExploreHorizon as
                soon as possible. We will assist in processing cancellations and
                refunds according to the provider’s terms.
              </li>
              <li>
                If you need to make changes to your booking, such as altering
                travel dates or modifying accommodations, you must contact
                ExploreHorizon for assistance. Changes are subject to
                availability and may incur additional fees, which will be
                communicated to you before proceeding with the modification.
                Some bookings may not allow for changes, depending on the
                provider’s terms. ExploreHorizon will make every effort to
                accommodate your requests, but we cannot guarantee that all
                changes will be possible.
              </li>
              <li>
                It is your responsibility to ensure that you have the
                appropriate travel documentation, including passports, visas,
                and identification, before your trip. ExploreHorizon is not
                responsible for any issues that arise from failure to obtain the
                necessary documentation. We recommend checking the entry
                requirements for your destination country well in advance of
                your travel date. If you are denied boarding or entry due to
                inadequate documentation, ExploreHorizon will not be liable for
                any resulting costs or disruptions.
              </li>
              <li>
                Before booking any travel arrangements, you should consider any
                health or safety risks associated with your destination.
                ExploreHorizon encourages you to consult with relevant
                authorities, such as the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) or
                the World Health Organization (WHO), for travel advisories and
                health precautions. You are responsible for obtaining any
                required vaccinations or medical clearances for your trip.
                ExploreHorizon is not liable for any health issues or injuries
                that occur during your travels.

                ExploreHorizon acts as an intermediary between you and the
                providers of travel services. While we strive to ensure that
                your travel experience meets your expectations, we are not
                responsible for any acts, errors, omissions, or failures on the
                part of third-party providers. Our liability is limited to the
                amount paid for the specific service in question. We are not
                responsible for indirect, incidental, or consequential damages,
                including but not limited to lost profits, lost opportunities,
                or disruptions to travel plans.

                epidemics, government restrictions, or technical failures. If a
                force majeure event occurs, we will make every effort to assist
                you in making alternative travel arrangements. However, refunds
                and compensation may not be available, depending on the
                circumstances and the policies of the travel service providers
                involved.
