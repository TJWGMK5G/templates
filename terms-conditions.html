                NextMoveEstates will not be held responsible for any delays or

                disasters, acts of government, or internet outages. Such events
                are considered force majeure, and we are excused from performing
                our obligations during the period of disruption. We will make
                reasonable efforts to resume services as soon as possible, but
                we are not liable for any losses or damages caused by force
                majeure events. Your obligations under these Terms remain in
                effect.
