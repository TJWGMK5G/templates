                Certain features or services on CricketQuest may require payment
                of fees. By purchasing these services, you agree to pay all
                applicable fees and taxes. Payments are processed through secure
                third-party payment processors. We do not store your credit card
                information on our servers. All fees are non-refundable unless

                We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your access to
                CricketQuest at any time and for any reason, without prior
                notice. Reasons for suspension or termination may include
                violation of these terms, illegal or fraudulent activity, or
                requests by law enforcement or regulatory authorities. Upon
                termination, your right to use CricketQuest will immediately
                cease, and we may delete or disable your account and all related
                information. You may terminate your account at any time by
                contacting us or using the account deletion option available on
                CricketQuest. Sections such as Intellectual Property,
                Indemnification, and Limitation of Liability shall survive
                termination of these terms.

                CricketQuest is provided on an "as is" and "as available" basis
                without warranties of any kind, either express or implied. We do
                not warrant that CricketQuest will be uninterrupted, error-free,
                secure, or free from viruses or other harmful components. Any
                content downloaded or obtained through CricketQuest is accessed
                at your own discretion and risk. We disclaim all warranties,
                express or implied, including but not limited to warranties of
                merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and
                non-infringement. We make no warranties regarding the accuracy,
                completeness, or reliability of any content or information

              <li>
                To the fullest extent permitted by law, CricketQuest and its
                affiliates, officers, directors, employees, and agents shall not
                be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential,
                or punitive damages. This includes damages for lost profits,
                lost data, or other intangible losses, even if CricketQuest has
                been advised of the possibility of such damages. In no event
                shall our total liability to you for all claims arising from or
                relating to CricketQuest exceed the amount paid by you, if any,
                for accessing CricketQuest during the twelve months preceding
                the claim. The limitations and exclusions of liability in these
                terms apply to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law.
                Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of
                liability for incidental or consequential damages, so the above
                limitations or exclusions may not apply to you.

                You agree to indemnify and hold CricketQuest and its affiliates,
                officers, directors, employees, and agents harmless from any
                claims, losses, damages, liabilities, costs, and expenses. This
                includes legal fees and expenses arising from your use of
                CricketQuest, your violation of these terms, or your violation
                of any rights of another person or entity. We reserve the right
                to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter
                otherwise subject to indemnification by you, in which case you
                agree to cooperate with our defense of such claims. This
                indemnification obligation will survive these terms and your use
                of CricketQuest.
              </li>
              <li>
                These terms and your use of CricketQuest shall be governed by
                and construed in accordance with the laws, without regard to its
                conflict of law principles. Any dispute arising from or relating
                to these terms or your use of CricketQuest shall be subject to
                the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located. You agree to
                waive any objection to jurisdiction and venue in such courts and
                to resolve disputes solely on an individual basis. If any
                provision of these terms is found to be invalid or unenforceable
                by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remaining provisions
                shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect. These terms
                constitute the entire agreement between you and CricketQuest
                regarding your use of the platform, superseding any prior
                agreements or communications.
