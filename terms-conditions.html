                These Terms and Conditions are governed by and construed in
                accordance with the laws of the jurisdiction in which JackpotIn

                termination, your right to use our services will immediately
                cease. All provisions of these terms which by their nature
                should survive termination shall survive, including, without
                limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers,
                indemnity, and limitations of liability. Termination will not
                affect any obligations or rights accrued prior to termination.
