                fraud or abuse, or requests by law enforcement or regulatory
                authorities. Upon termination of your access to CricketChamp,
                you must cease all use of the platform and any associated

                costs, and expenses, including legal fees, arising from or
                related to your use of CricketChamp or any breach of these
                terms. This indemnification obligation shall survive the
                termination of your access to CricketChamp and the expiration or
                termination of these terms. CricketChamp reserves the right to
                assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter subject
                to indemnification by you, in which case you agree to cooperate
                with CricketChamp in asserting any available defenses.
              </li>
              <li>
                Any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or relating to
                these terms or your use of CricketChamp shall be resolved
                through arbitration administered in accordance with its rules.
                The arbitration shall take place and shall be conducted in
                English. The decision of the arbitrator shall be final and
                binding upon both parties, and judgment on the award rendered by
                the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction
                thereof. Each party shall bear its own costs and expenses
                incurred in connection with the arbitration proceedings,
                including legal fees and expenses. This dispute resolution
                clause shall not prevent either party from seeking injunctive
                relief or other equitable remedies in a court of competent
                jurisdiction.

                You waive any right to participate in any class action or
                representative proceeding against CricketChamp or its

                CricketChamp shall not be liable for any failure or delay in
                performing its obligations under these terms if such failure or
                delay is caused by circumstances beyond its reasonable control,
                including but not limited to acts of God, natural disasters,
