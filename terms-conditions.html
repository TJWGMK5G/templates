                As a user of PartyDreams services, you agree to provide accurate
                and complete information during the planning process. You are
                responsible for ensuring that all details provided are current

                comply with all applicable laws and regulations in connection

                services, including but not limited to misrepresentation, fraud,
                or illegal activities, will result in the termination of our
                agreement. We expect all clients to act in good faith and

                Payment for PartyDreams services must be made in accordance with
                the agreed-upon terms. We require a deposit to secure your event
                date, with the remaining balance due prior to the event as
                outlined in your contract. Failure to make payments on time may
                result in the cancellation of your event, and deposits may be
                forfeited as outlined in our cancellation policy. We accept
                various forms of payment, and any additional fees or charges
                will be communicated to you in advance. Clear communication and
                timely payments are essential to ensuring the success of your
                event.

                If you need to cancel your event, please notify PartyDreams as
                soon as possible. Cancellations made within a specified period
                may result in a partial or full forfeiture of your deposit,
                depending on the timing and nature of the cancellation. We will
                work with you to reschedule or adjust your event as needed,
                subject to availability and additional fees. In the unlikely
                event that PartyDreams must cancel your event, we will provide a
                full refund of any payments made. Our goal is to be as flexible
                and accommodating as possible while protecting our business
                interests.

                This includes, but is not limited to, natural disasters,

                PartyDreams works with a network of trusted vendors to provide
                high-quality services for your event. While we recommend these
                vendors based on their expertise and reliability, we do not
                assume liability for their performance. Any agreements or
                contracts with third-party vendors are separate from our
                services, and you are responsible for reviewing and
                understanding their terms. We will assist in coordinating with
                vendors and ensuring they meet your expectations. Our goal is to
                create a seamless experience by collaborating with the best in
                the industry.

                We understand that event details may change, and we are
                committed to accommodating reasonable modifications. Any changes
                to your event must be communicated to PartyDreams in writing as
                soon as possible. We will do our best to implement the changes,
                subject to availability and potential additional costs.
                Significant changes may require a revision of your contract and
                adjustments to the payment schedule. Clear and timely
                communication is essential to ensure that all changes are
                handled efficiently and effectively.
