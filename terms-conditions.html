                SerenitySpaces provides interior design services, consultation,
                and project management to our clients. Our services are tailored
                to meet the unique needs and preferences of each client. We
                strive to deliver high-quality designs that reflect your style
                and functionality requirements. Detailed information about our
                services can be found on our website. Any specific requirements
                or requests should be discussed directly with our team to ensure
                clarity and understanding.
              </h2>
              <li>
                As a client, you are responsible for providing accurate
                information about your project requirements. This includes
                budgets, timelines, and design preferences. Timely communication
                and feedback are crucial to ensure the success of your project.
                Additionally, you agree to cooperate with our team throughout
                the design process. Failure to provide necessary information may
                lead to delays in project completion.
              </li>
              <li>
                All content and materials on our website, including but not
                limited to text, images, and graphics, are protected by
                intellectual property laws. SerenitySpaces retains ownership of
                all intellectual property rights associated with our designs and
                materials. You may not reproduce, distribute, or modify any of
                our content without prior written permission. Any designs
                created for you by SerenitySpaces are for your personal use and
                cannot be reproduced commercially without consent. Respecting
                our intellectual property is essential for maintaining the
                integrity of our brand.
              </li>
              <li>
                We understand that changes may occur during the design process.
                Clients are entitled to a specified number of revisions as
                outlined in the project agreement. Any changes requested beyond
                the agreed-upon scope may incur additional charges. We encourage
                open communication regarding any desired adjustments to ensure
                your satisfaction. Flexibility is key in achieving the best
                design outcome, and we aim to accommodate reasonable requests.
              </li>
              <li>
                Clients may cancel their project at any time, but cancellation
                must be communicated in writing. Depending on the stage of the
                project, cancellation fees may apply. If work has already
                commenced, the client may be responsible for costs incurred up
                to the cancellation date. We will provide a detailed breakdown
                of any fees applicable to the cancellation. Understanding this
                policy helps us maintain clear expectations throughout the
                project.

                external sites. Your safety and security while browsing are
                important, so always exercise caution.

                We welcome your feedback and reviews regarding our services.
                Your insights help us improve and serve our clients better. By
                submitting feedback, you grant SerenitySpaces the right to use
                your comments for promotional purposes. We appreciate your

                SerenitySpaces shall not be liable for any failure to perform
                our obligations under these Terms and Conditions due to
                circumstances beyond our control. This includes natural
                disasters, acts of government, or other events that may hinder
                our ability to provide services. If such an event occurs, we
                will make reasonable efforts to notify you and resume services
                as soon as possible. Understanding the implications of force
                majeure helps manage expectations during unforeseen
                circumstances. Your patience and understanding are greatly
                appreciated.
              </li>
              <li>
                In the event of a dispute, we encourage clients to contact us
                directly to seek resolution. We believe that open communication
                can often lead to satisfactory solutions without the need for
                legal action. Should legal proceedings be necessary, disputes
                will be resolved through binding arbitration. Clients agree to
                waive their right to a jury trial in such instances. Our goal is
                to ensure that any disagreements are handled fairly and
                efficiently.
