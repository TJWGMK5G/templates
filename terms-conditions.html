                Limitation of Liability: SkylineRealty shall not be liable for
                any direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or
                exemplary damages, including but not limited to loss of profits,
                goodwill, or data, arising out of or in connection with your use
                of our website or services. This limitation of liability applies
                whether the alleged liability is based on contract, tort,
                negligence, strict liability, or any other legal theory, even if
                SkylineRealty has been advised of the possibility of such
                damages. In jurisdictions that do not allow the exclusion or
                limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages,
                SkylineRealty's liability is limited to the greatest extent
                permitted by law. SkylineRealty shall not be liable for any
                delay or failure to perform its obligations under these Terms
                and Conditions due to circumstances beyond its reasonable
                control, including but not limited to acts of God, natural
                disasters, or government actions. You agree to indemnify and
                hold harmless SkylineRealty, its affiliates, agents, employees,
                and licensors from any claims, losses, damages, liabilities,
                costs, and expenses arising out of or in connection with your
                use of our website or services.
              </li>
              <li>
                Governing Law: These Terms and Conditions shall be governed by
                and construed in accordance with the laws of the jurisdiction
                where SkylineRealty is located, without regard to its conflict
                of law provisions. Any dispute arising out of or in connection
                with these Terms and Conditions shall be subject to the
                exclusive jurisdiction of the courts in the jurisdiction where
                SkylineRealty is located. If any provision of these Terms and
                Conditions is found to be invalid or unenforceable by a court of
                competent jurisdiction, the remaining provisions shall remain in
                full force and effect. The failure of SkylineRealty to enforce
                any right or provision of these Terms and Conditions shall not
                constitute a waiver of such right or provision. These Terms and
                Conditions constitute the entire agreement between you and
                SkylineRealty regarding your use of our website and services,
                superseding any prior agreements or understandings

              <li>
                Dispute Resolution: Any dispute, controversy, or claim arising
                out of or relating to these Terms and Conditions, or the breach,
                termination, or invalidity thereof, shall be settled by
                arbitration in accordance with the rules of the arbitration
                institution designated by SkylineRealty. The arbitration shall
                be conducted in the English language and held in the
                jurisdiction where SkylineRealty is located. The decision of the
                arbitrator shall be final and binding upon both parties, and
                judgment upon the arbitration award may be entered in any court
                having jurisdiction thereof. Each party shall bear its own costs
                and expenses of arbitration, including legal fees and expenses.
                Nothing in this section shall prevent either party from seeking
                injunctive or other equitable relief from a court of competent
                jurisdiction.
              </li>

                Amendments: SkylineRealty reserves the right to amend or modify
                these Terms and Conditions at any time without prior notice. Any
                amendments or modifications to these Terms and Conditions will
                be effective immediately upon posting on our website. Your
                continued use of our website or services after the posting of
                amendments or modifications constitutes acceptance of those
                changes. If you do not agree to the amended or modified Terms
                and Conditions, you must stop using our website and services
                immediately.
              </li>
              <li>
                Severability: If any provision of these Terms and Conditions is
                determined to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable by a court
                of competent jurisdiction, the remaining provisions shall remain
                in full force and effect to the fullest extent permitted by law.
                The invalidity, illegality, or unenforceability of any provision
                shall not affect the validity, legality, or enforceability of
                the remaining provisions.
