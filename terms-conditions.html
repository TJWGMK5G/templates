                The failure of CricketHeroes to enforce any provision of these
                terms and conditions shall not be construed as a waiver of such
                provision or the right to enforce it at a later time. Any waiver
                of a provision by CricketHeroes must be in writing and shall not
                constitute a waiver of any other provision or subsequent breach
                of the same provision.
