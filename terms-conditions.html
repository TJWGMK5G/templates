                We are committed to promoting responsible gambling and providing
                support to those affected by problem gambling. You may set
                deposit limits, betting limits, or self-exclusion periods on
                your account to manage your gambling activity. If you believe
                you have a gambling problem, we encourage you to seek help from
                a qualified professional or contact a gambling support
                organization for assistance. We reserve the right to suspend or
                terminate your account if we suspect you have a gambling problem
                or are engaging in compulsive gambling behavior. We may also
                take additional measures to prevent you from accessing the
                website or placing bets if we believe it is in your best
                interest.

                Any disputes or claims arising out of or relating to these Terms
                and Conditions or your use of the WinStake website shall be
                resolved through binding arbitration. The arbitration shall be
                conducted in accordance with the rules of the American
                Arbitration Association. The decision of the arbitrator shall be
                final and binding on all parties and may be enforced in any
                court of competent jurisdiction. Each party shall bear its own
                costs and expenses associated with the arbitration, including
                legal fees and expenses. This dispute resolution provision shall
                survive the termination of these Terms and Conditions.
              </li>
              <li>
                To the fullest extent permitted by law, WinStake shall not be
                liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or
                punitive damages arising out of or related to your use of the
                website. In no event shall WinStake's total liability to you
                exceed the amount paid by you, if any, for accessing or using
                the website.
              </li>
              <li>
                We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your access to the
                WinStake website at any time for any reason, without prior
                notice. Upon termination, you must cease all use of the website
                and destroy any copies of materials obtained from the website.
                Sections of these Terms and Conditions that by their nature
                should survive termination, including but not limited to
                intellectual property rights, dispute resolution, and limitation
                of liability, shall survive termination.
              </li>
              <li>
                These Terms and Conditions shall be governed by and construed in
                accordance with the laws, without regard to its conflict of law
                principles. Any disputes arising out of or related to these
                Terms and Conditions shall be subject to the exclusive
                jurisdiction of the courts.
              </li>
              <li>
                If any provision of these Terms and Conditions is found to be
                invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall remain
                in full force and effect. The invalid or unenforceable provision
                shall be replaced by a valid and enforceable provision that most
                closely matches the intent of the original provision.
              </li>
              <li>
                The failure of WinStake to enforce any provision of these Terms
                and Conditions shall not be deemed a waiver of such provision or
                any other provision. The waiver of any provision of these Terms
                and Conditions shall not be construed as a waiver of any
                subsequent breach of that provision or any other provision.
              </li>
              <li>
