                are responsible for the cost of return shipping unless the
                product is defective or the return is due to an error on our
                part. Refunds will be issued to the original payment method
                within a reasonable timeframe after we receive and inspect the
                returned items.

                Limitation of Liability. CoffeeCove and its affiliates,
                officers, directors, employees, agents, and suppliers shall not
                be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, or
                consequential damages arising out of or related to your use of

                Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of
                liability for consequential or incidental damages, so the above
                limitation may not apply to you.

              <li>
                Indemnification. You agree to indemnify and hold harmless

                losses, costs, expenses, or fees arising out of or related to
                your use of the website, violation of these Terms and
                Conditions, or infringement of any intellectual property or
                other rights of any person or entity.
              </li>
              <li>
                Governing Law. These Terms and Conditions shall be governed by
                and construed in accordance with the laws of [Jurisdiction],
                without regard to its conflict of law provisions. Any dispute
                arising from or relating to these Terms or your use of the
                website shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the
                courts located in [Jurisdiction]. The United Nations Convention
                on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods shall not apply

                Entire Agreement. These Terms and Conditions constitute the
                entire agreement between you and CoffeeCove regarding your use
                of the website and supersede all prior or contemporaneous
                agreements and understandings, whether oral or written. Any
                waiver of any provision of these Terms by CoffeeCove shall not
                be deemed a waiver of any other provision or of CoffeeCove's
                right to require strict observance of each of the terms herein.

                provisions shall nevertheless be enforceable to the fullest
                extent permitted by applicable law. The invalidity, illegality,
                or unenforceability of any provision shall not affect the
                validity, legality, or enforceability of any other provision.

              <li>
