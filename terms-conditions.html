                Titan Strength Gym offers various membership options, including
                monthly, quarterly, and annual plans. Each membership type comes

                days in advance. It is your responsibility to understand the
                terms associated with your chosen membership type.
              </h2>

                our facilities during operating hours, participate in classes,
                and receive support from our staff. You are expected to adhere
                to gym rules, maintain respect for other members, and use
                equipment responsibly. Any form of harassment or disruptive
                behavior will not be tolerated and may result in membership
                suspension or termination. We encourage a positive and
                supportive environment for all members to thrive in their
                fitness journey. Your cooperation is essential in upholding our

              <li>
                Before engaging in any exercise or fitness activities, members
                are strongly advised to consult with a healthcare professional.
                Titan Strength Gym is not liable for any injuries sustained
                while using our facilities or participating in our programs.
                Members are responsible for ensuring they are in adequate health
                and physical condition to undertake exercise. We prioritize
                safety and may require you to complete a health questionnaire
                during the registration process. Please inform our staff of any
                medical conditions that may affect your ability to participate.
              </li>
              <li>
                Members are entitled to use all available gym equipment and
                facilities during operating hours. It is your responsibility to
                familiarize yourself with the gym layout and equipment. All
                equipment must be returned to its designated place after use.
                Titan Strength Gym reserves the right to limit access to certain
                facilities or equipment during peak hours or for maintenance.
                Please report any damaged or malfunctioning equipment to our
                staff immediately.

                Members have the option to book personal training sessions for
                an additional fee. Personal trainers at Titan Strength Gym are
                certified professionals who are dedicated to helping you achieve
                your fitness goals. Sessions must be scheduled in advance and
                are subject to trainer availability. Cancellations must be made
                at least 24 hours prior to the scheduled session to avoid being
                charged for the missed appointment. We encourage open

                experience.

                consideration. Any form of discrimination, harassment, or
                intimidation will not be tolerated and may result in immediate
                expulsion from the gym. Titan Strength Gym reserves the right to
                revoke membership for any violations of this code. We are
                committed to fostering a positive and welcoming environment for
