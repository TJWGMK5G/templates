              <li>
                Clients of AuraDesign are responsible for providing accurate and
                complete information necessary for the design process. This
                includes specifications, measurements, preferences, and any
                other relevant details required to complete the project. Clients
                must communicate any changes or modifications to the project
                scope in a timely manner. AuraDesign will make reasonable
                efforts to accommodate changes but reserves the right to adjust
                project timelines and costs accordingly. Clients are responsible
                for reviewing and approving designs, layouts, and other project
                deliverables before final implementation. AuraDesign is not
                liable for any dissatisfaction or issues arising from
                client-approved designs. Clients agree to make timely payments
                for services rendered by AuraDesign as outlined in the
                agreed-upon project proposal or contract. Late payments may
                incur penalties or suspension of services until payment is
                received. Clients acknowledge that delays in providing necessary
                information or approvals may impact project timelines and
                delivery dates. AuraDesign will not be held responsible for
                delays caused by client actions or inactions.
              </li>
              <li>
                AuraDesign's payment terms are specified in our project
                proposals or contracts and are due upon receipt unless otherwise
                agreed upon in writing. Payment methods accepted by AuraDesign
                include credit card, bank transfer, or other methods as
                specified. Clients agree to pay all applicable fees, taxes, and
                charges associated with the services provided by AuraDesign.
                Failure to pay invoices by the due date may result in late fees
                or suspension of services until payment is received. AuraDesign
                reserves the right to adjust project costs if there are changes
                in project scope, requirements, or unforeseen circumstances that
                impact the scope of work originally agreed upon. All payments
                made to AuraDesign are non-refundable once services have been
                rendered, unless otherwise specified in our refund policy or as
                required by law. AuraDesign may use third-party payment
                processors to facilitate payment transactions. Clients are
                responsible for reviewing and agreeing to the terms and
                conditions of these third-party processors before making
                payments.
              </li>
              <li>
                AuraDesign and clients agree to maintain the confidentiality of
                sensitive information exchanged during the course of the
                project. This includes but is not limited to business
                strategies, proprietary information, and project details not
                publicly disclosed. AuraDesign will not disclose confidential
                information to third parties without the client's consent,
                except as required by law or to facilitate the provision of
                services by subcontractors or third-party service providers.
                Clients agree not to disclose AuraDesign's confidential
                information, including but not limited to pricing,
                methodologies, and proprietary tools, to any third party without
                our prior written consent. AuraDesign will take reasonable
                measures to protect the confidentiality and security of client
                information, including the use of encryption and secure
                communication channels when transmitting sensitive data. The
                confidentiality obligations outlined in these terms and
                conditions will survive the termination of any project or
                contractual agreement between AuraDesign and the client.

              <li>
                To the extent permitted by law, AuraDesign shall not be liable
                for any direct, indirect, incidental, consequential, special, or
                punitive damages arising out of or in any way connected with
                your use of our website or services. AuraDesign's liability for
                any claim arising from or related to our services shall not
                exceed the total amount paid by you to AuraDesign for the
                specific services giving rise to the claim. AuraDesign makes no
                warranties or representations about the accuracy or completeness
                of the information on our website or the suitability of our
                services for your specific needs. Clients agree to indemnify and
                hold harmless AuraDesign, its employees, directors, and agents
                from any claims, damages, losses, liabilities, costs, or
                expenses (including legal fees) arising out of or related to
                your use of our website or services. The limitations of
                liability and indemnification provisions in these terms and
                conditions shall apply regardless of the form of action, whether
                in contract, tort (including negligence), strict liability, or
                otherwise.
              </li>
              <li>
                Any dispute arising from or relating to these terms and
                conditions, our website, or our services shall be resolved
                through good faith negotiations between the parties. If a
                dispute cannot be resolved informally, both parties agree to
                submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located in UK
                for the resolution of any legal proceedings arising from or
                related to these terms and conditions. AuraDesign and clients
                agree to waive any right to a trial by jury in any legal
                proceedings arising from or related to these terms and
                conditions, our website, or our services. The prevailing party
                in any legal proceedings arising from or related to these terms
                and conditions shall be entitled to recover its reasonable
                attorney's fees and costs incurred in connection with such
                proceedings. These dispute resolution provisions shall survive
                the termination of any project or contractual agreement between
                AuraDesign and the client.

              </li>
              <li>
                AuraDesign reserves the right to terminate or suspend your
                access to our website and services at any time and for any
                reason without prior notice. Clients may terminate their
                engagement with AuraDesign by providing written notice of
                termination and settling any outstanding invoices or fees owed
                to AuraDesign. In the event of termination by either party,
                AuraDesign will provide clients with access to project
                deliverables completed up to the termination date, subject to
                payment of all applicable fees. Upon termination, clients agree
                to cease using any materials, designs, or intellectual property
                provided by AuraDesign, unless otherwise agreed upon in writing.
                AuraDesign's termination of services shall not relieve clients
                of their obligations under these terms and conditions, including
                payment obligations accrued prior to the termination date.
              </li>

              <li>
                These terms and conditions shall be governed by and construed in
                accordance with the laws of UK, without regard to its conflict
                of law principles. Any legal proceedings arising from or related
                to these terms and conditions shall be brought exclusively in
                the courts located in UK, and both parties consent to the
                jurisdiction of such courts. If any provision of these terms and
                conditions is found to be unlawful, void, or unenforceable, such
                provision shall be deemed severable from these terms and
                conditions and shall not affect the validity and enforceability
                of any remaining provisions. These terms and conditions
                constitute the entire agreement between AuraDesign and clients
                regarding the use of our website and services, superseding any
                prior agreements or understandings between the parties.
                AuraDesign's failure to enforce any right or provision of these
                terms and conditions shall not be considered a waiver of such
                right or provision.
