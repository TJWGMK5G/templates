                Unauthorized use of course materials may result in disciplinary

              <h2 class="main-terms__h2">
                Regular attendance and active participation in all scheduled
                classes, simulations, and flight training sessions are
                mandatory. Failure to attend without a valid reason may result
                in penalties, including additional fees, extended training time,
                or dismissal from the program. You must notify the academy in
                advance if you are unable to attend any session due to illness
                or other valid reasons. We emphasize the importance of
                commitment and punctuality in your training to ensure your
                success as a pilot.

              <li>
                Your progress in the aviation training program will be
                continuously evaluated through written exams, practical tests,
                and performance reviews. You must meet the minimum required
                standards set by CAA and the DGCA to successfully complete the
                program. If you fail to meet these standards, remedial training
                or retesting may be required at an additional cost. Persistent
                failure to achieve the required competencies may result in your
                removal from the program. We aim to provide the necessary
                support and resources to help you succeed.
              </li>

              <li>
                Upon successful completion of the training program and passing
                all required examinations, you will be eligible to receive a
                certificate from CAA and apply for the relevant pilot license
                from the DGCA. Certification is contingent upon meeting all
                academic and practical requirements as well as adherence to
                CAA's code of conduct. We do not guarantee the issuance of a
                license, as it is subject to the discretion of the DGCA and your
                performance during the assessments. The academy will provide
                guidance and support during the licensing process.
              </li>
              <li>
                CAA prioritizes the health and safety of all students and staff.
                You are required to comply with all health and safety
                regulations established by the academy and the DGCA. This
                includes undergoing regular medical examinations to ensure
                fitness to fly. Any health issues that may affect your ability
                to safely operate an aircraft must be reported immediately.
                Non-compliance with safety regulations may result in suspension
                or termination from the program. We are committed to maintaining
                a safe and secure training environment.

                All official communication between you and CAA will be conducted
                through the contact details provided during your registration.
                It is your responsibility to keep your contact information up to
                date. We will communicate important updates, including changes
                to the program, schedules, or policies, via email or other
                official channels. Failure to check and respond to official
                communications in a timely manner may result in missed
                information, for which CAA is not responsible. Please ensure
                that you regularly monitor your inbox and other communication
                platforms.

                CAA reserves the right to terminate your enrollment if you fail
                to comply with the terms and conditions, code of conduct, or
                academic requirements. If you wish to withdraw from the program,
                you must notify the academy in writing, stating your reasons for
                withdrawal. Refunds, if applicable, will be processed according
                to our refund policy. Termination or withdrawal from the program
                may have implications for your future eligibility to re-enroll
                or pursue a career in aviation. We encourage open communication
                to address any issues before they lead to termination or
                withdrawal.

                including curriculum, schedules, instructors, and training
                facilities, as deemed necessary. Any amendments will be
                communicated to students in advance, and we will make reasonable
                efforts to minimize disruptions. Changes may be made to comply
                with new regulations, improve the quality of training, or
                respond to operational requirements. Your continued
                participation in the program following any changes constitutes
                acceptance of the revised terms. We strive to maintain the
                highest standards of training despite any necessary adjustments.

                a complaint, please report it to the administration office in
                writing. We will investigate the matter promptly and take
                appropriate action. All complaints are handled with
                confidentiality and sensitivity. Our aim is to ensure that all
                students have a positive learning experience and any issues are
