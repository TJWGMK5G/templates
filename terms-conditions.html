                When you engage with Celebration Craft for event planning
                services, a formal agreement outlining the scope, fees, and
                terms will be established. This agreement will detail the
                services provided, payment terms, and any specific requirements
                for your event. It is important to review this agreement
                carefully to ensure all aspects of our services meet your
                expectations. Any changes or additional services requested after
                the agreement is signed may incur additional charges.

                special requirements. Failure to provide necessary information
                may impact our ability to deliver the services as planned. We
                rely on your cooperation to ensure the smooth execution of your
                event.

                These Terms and Conditions are governed by and construed in
                accordance with the laws of the jurisdiction in which
                Celebration Craft operates. Any disputes arising from these
                terms or your use of our services will be subject to the
                exclusive jurisdiction of the courts in that jurisdiction. We
                encourage you to seek legal advice if you have any questions
                about your rights and obligations under these terms.
              </li>

                In the event of a dispute, we encourage you to contact us to
                seek resolution. We are committed to resolving conflicts
                amicably and will work with you to address any issues. If a
                resolution cannot be reached through direct negotiation, we may
                seek alternative dispute resolution methods such as mediation or
                arbitration. Legal proceedings will be a last resort if other
                methods fail.

                will be liable for any outstanding payments or damages. We will
                make reasonable efforts to resolve any issues before terminating
                services. Upon termination, you must cease all use of our
