                notify you of any claims against you. Cooperation with us in

                We may update these Terms and Conditions periodically to reflect
                changes in our services or legal requirements. Significant
                changes will be communicated through the platform. It is your
                responsibility to review the Terms regularly. Continued use of

                Any disputes arising from these Terms or your use of
                BattingLegends will be resolved through binding arbitration.
                This process is an alternative to litigation and aims to resolve
                issues efficiently. The arbitration will be conducted in
                accordance with local regulations. We encourage resolving
                disputes amicably before initiating formal proceedings.
                Arbitration provides a streamlined approach to conflict
                resolution.

                We are not liable for any failure to perform our obligations due
                to circumstances beyond our control. This includes natural
                disasters, war, or other events that disrupt our services. In
                such cases, we will make reasonable efforts to resume normal
                operations. Your understanding and cooperation during such
                events are appreciated. Force majeure events are an unavoidable
                part of operating a platform.

                Failure to enforce any provision of these Terms does not
                constitute a waiver of that provision. We retain the right to
                enforce any term or condition at any time. Waiver of any term is
                only effective if explicitly agreed upon in writing. Maintaining
                the right to enforce terms ensures consistency in the
                application of these Terms. We reserve the right to act on any
                breaches as needed.
              </li>
              <li>
                If any provision of these Terms is found to be invalid or
                unenforceable, the remaining provisions will continue to apply.
                The invalid provision will be modified to reflect the parties'
                intentions as closely as possible. Severability ensures that the
                rest of the Terms remain effective and enforceable. This
                approach maintains the integrity of the agreement. We strive to
                ensure that all terms are legally sound and applicable.

                No other terms or conditions will be binding unless agreed upon
                in writing. This agreement ensures clarity and completeness in
                our relationship. By using BattingLegends, you acknowledge that

                violate these terms. Your actions should always reflect respect
