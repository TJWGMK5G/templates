                HighStakes and its affiliates, officers, directors, employees,
                and agents are not liable for any direct, indirect, incidental,
                special, or consequential damages arising out of or in any way
                connected with your use of our website or services. This
                includes but is not limited to damages for loss of profits,
                goodwill, use, data, or other intangible losses, even if we have
                been advised of the possibility of such damages. In
                jurisdictions where the exclusion or limitation of liability for
                consequential or incidental damages is not allowed, our
                liability is limited to the maximum extent permitted by law.
                HighStakes is not responsible for any acts or omissions of third
                parties, including but not limited to suppliers, service
                providers, or other guests. Our total liability to you for any
                claim arising out of or related to these terms or your use of
                our website and services shall not exceed the amount paid by you
                to HighStakes in the preceding twelve months.
              </li>
              <li>
                You agree to indemnify and hold harmless HighStakes and its
                affiliates, officers, directors, employees, and agents from any
                claims, liabilities, damages, losses, or expenses, including
                legal fees, arising out of or in any way related to your use of
                our website or services, violation of these terms, or
                infringement of any intellectual property or other rights of any
                person or entity.

              <li>
                These terms and your use of HighStakes are governed by the laws,
                without regard to its conflict of law principles. Any dispute,
                claim, or controversy arising out of or relating to these terms
                or your use of our website shall be resolved exclusively in the
                courts. You agree to waive any right to a jury trial and to
                participate in class actions against HighStakes. If any
                provision of these terms is found to be invalid or
                unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall continue to be
                valid and enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by law.
                The failure of HighStakes to enforce any right or provision of
                these terms shall not be deemed a waiver of such right or
                provision.
              </li>
              <li>
                HighStakes reserves the right to modify, suspend, or terminate
                your access to our website and services at any time without
                prior notice. We may also terminate these terms with you if we
                believe you have breached these terms or engaged in unlawful or
                fraudulent activities. Upon termination, you must cease all use
                of our website and services, and any provisions that by their
                nature should survive termination shall continue to apply. You
                may terminate these terms at any time by discontinuing your use
                of our website and services and closing your account, if
                applicable. Sections such as intellectual property rights,
                limitation of liability, indemnification, and dispute resolution
                shall survive termination of these terms.
