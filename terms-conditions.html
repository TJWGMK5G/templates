                By accessing and using the BettingBooks website, you acknowledge
                and agree to be bound by these terms and conditions. These terms
                apply to all visitors, users, and others who access or use our
                website. If you do not agree with any part of these terms, you
                may not access the website or purchase books from us.

              <h2>
                All orders placed through BettingBooks are subject to
                availability and acceptance. Upon placing an order, you will
                receive an email confirmation acknowledging receipt of your
                order. This confirmation does not constitute acceptance of your
                order; acceptance occurs when we dispatch the ordered books to
                you.
              </h2>
              <li>
                We reserve the right to refuse any order placed with us. In such
                cases, we will notify you as soon as possible and provide a full
                refund where applicable. Pricing of books displayed on our
                website is subject to change without notice. Such changes will
                not affect orders that have already been accepted.
              </li>
              <li>
                While we strive to provide accurate descriptions and images of
                our books, we do not guarantee that all descriptions and images
                are complete, current, or error-free. Any reliance on the
                material on this site is at your own risk.
              </li>
              <li>
                BettingBooks reserves the right to modify or discontinue any
                book or service without notice at any time. We shall not be
                liable to you or to any third-party for any modification, price
                change, suspension, or discontinuance of the service.
              </li>
              <li>
                Payment for orders placed through BettingBooks must be made in
                full at the time of purchase. We accept major credit cards and
                other payment methods as specified on our website. You agree to
                provide current, complete, and accurate purchase and account
                information for all purchases made on our website.
              </li>
              <li>
                Once an order is placed, you will receive an email confirmation
                detailing the specifics of your purchase. Please review this
                confirmation for accuracy and contact us immediately if any
                information is incorrect. We reserve the right to limit or
                prohibit orders that, in our judgment, appear to be placed by
                dealers, resellers, or distributors.

                Shipping costs and delivery times vary depending on your
                location and the shipping method selected at checkout. We aim to
                process and ship orders promptly, but we cannot guarantee
                specific delivery dates. Risk of loss and title for books
                purchased from BettingBooks pass to you upon delivery of the
                items to the carrier.

                Returns and exchanges are subject to our Return Policy, which
                outlines the conditions under which books may be returned or
                exchanged. To be eligible for a return, your item must be unused
                and in the same condition that you received it. It must also be
                in the original packaging.
              </li>
              <li>
                You may cancel your order before it has been shipped for a full
                refund. Once shipped, our standard Return Policy applies.
                Refunds will be processed promptly upon receipt of returned
                items and will be credited to the original payment method used
                for the purchase.
