                These Terms and Conditions are governed by and construed in
                accordance with the laws of the jurisdiction in which The Sunset
                Hotel is located. Any disputes arising from these terms will be
                resolved in the courts of that jurisdiction. By using our
                website and services, you consent to the exclusive jurisdiction

              <li>
                If any provision of these Terms and Conditions is found to be
                invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions will continue
                to be valid and enforceable. The invalid or unenforceable
                provision will be replaced with a valid and enforceable
                provision that most closely matches the intent of the original
                provision. This ensures that these terms remain in effect to the
                fullest extent possible.
