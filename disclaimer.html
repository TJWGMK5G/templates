                DiamondDen Casino-Hotel, its affiliates, and their respective
                officers, directors, employees, or agents shall not be liable
                for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or

                use the website or any content on the website. This limitation
                of liability applies whether the alleged liability is based on

                basis, even if DiamondDen Casino-Hotel has been advised of the
                possibility of such damage. Because some jurisdictions do not
