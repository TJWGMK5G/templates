              <li>
                In no event shall The Diamond Haven, its affiliates, directors,
                officers, employees, agents, or suppliers be liable to you for
                any direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or
                punitive damages arising out of or in any way connected with
                your use of our website or services. This limitation of
                liability applies whether the alleged liability is based on
                contract, tort, negligence, strict liability, or any other
                basis, even if we have been advised of the possibility of such
                damages. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or
                limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages,
                so the above limitation may not apply to you. In no event shall
                our total liability to you for all damages, losses, and causes
                of action (whether in contract, tort, or otherwise) exceed the
                amount paid by you, if any, for accessing our website or using
                our services. You acknowledge that the limitations and
                exclusions of liability in this disclaimer are reasonable and
                that without them, we would not be able to offer our website and
                services to you on an economically feasible basis.

                suppliers, from and against any and all claims, liabilities,

                use of our website. We reserve the right to assume the exclusive
                defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to
                indemnification by you, in which event you will cooperate in
                asserting any available defenses.

                Any dispute arising out of or related to this disclaimer shall
                be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts. If any
                provision of this disclaimer is found to be invalid or
