                To the fullest extent permitted by law, CricketQuest, its
                affiliates, officers, directors, employees, agents, suppliers,
                or licensors shall not be liable for any direct, indirect,
                incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages,
                including without limitation, loss of profits, data, use,
                goodwill, or other intangible losses, resulting from (i) your

                cause or duration of the liability, whether arising in contract,
                tort (including negligence), strict liability, or otherwise.
                This disclaimer of liability applies to any damages or injury
                caused by any failure of performance, error, omission,
                interruption, deletion, defect, delay in operation or
                transmission, computer virus, communication line failure, theft
