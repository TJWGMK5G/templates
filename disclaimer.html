                be deemed modified so that it is valid and enforceable to the
                maximum extent permitted by law. The failure to enforce any
                right or provision of this disclaimer shall not constitute a

                condition, and any failure of RootKitchen to assert a right or
                provision under this disclaimer shall not constitute a waiver of
                such right or provision.
