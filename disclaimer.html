                Limitation of Liability: In no event shall SkylineRealty or its
                affiliates, agents, employees, or licensors be liable to you or
                any third party for any direct, indirect, incidental, special,
                or consequential damages arising out of or in any way connected
                with the use of our website or services. This limitation of
                liability applies whether the alleged liability is based on
                contract, tort, negligence, strict liability, or any other legal
                theory, even if SkylineRealty has been advised of the
                possibility of such damages. Some jurisdictions do not allow the
                exclusion or limitation of liability for consequential or
                incidental damages, so the above limitation may not apply to
                you. In such jurisdictions, SkylineRealty's liability is limited
                to the greatest extent permitted by law.

                Investment Risks: Real estate investments involve inherent
                risks, including but not limited to market fluctuations,
                economic downturns, and property value depreciation. Past
                performance of real estate investments is not indicative of
                future results, and there is no guarantee of profitability or
                return on investment. SkylineRealty does not provide investment
                advice and recommends that users consult with financial advisors
                or investment professionals before making real estate investment
                decisions. Users should carefully consider their financial
                situation, investment objectives, and risk tolerance before
                investing in real estate. SkylineRealty shall not be liable for
                any losses or damages resulting from real estate investment
                decisions made based on information obtained from our website.

                Property Inspections: SkylineRealty recommends that users
                conduct thorough property inspections before purchasing or
                leasing any property. Inspections may reveal defects, structural
                issues, or other problems that could affect the value or
                suitability of the property. Users should hire qualified
                inspectors to assess the condition of properties and provide
                detailed reports on any findings. SkylineRealty does not perform
                property inspections and shall not be liable for any defects or
                issues discovered after a property is purchased or leased. Users
                are responsible for conducting their own due diligence and
                should not rely solely on information provided by SkylineRealty.

                Lease Agreements: Lease agreements for rental properties listed
                on SkylineRealty's website are between the property owner and
                the tenant. SkylineRealty acts solely as a facilitator in
                connecting landlords with potential tenants and does not become
                a party to lease agreements. Users should review lease
                agreements carefully and seek legal advice if needed before
                signing any contracts. SkylineRealty does not guarantee the
                terms or conditions of lease agreements and shall not be liable
                for any disputes or issues arising between landlords and
                tenants. Users should understand their rights and obligations as
                landlords or tenants under applicable landlord-tenant laws and
                regulations.

                Property Taxes: Users should be aware of property tax
                obligations associated with owning or leasing real estate.
                Property tax rates and assessment methods vary by jurisdiction
                and may change over time. SkylineRealty does not provide tax
                advice and recommends that users consult with tax professionals
                or assessors regarding property tax matters. Users are
                responsible for paying property taxes on properties they own or
                occupy, and failure to do so may result in penalties or legal
                consequences. SkylineRealty shall not be liable for any
                tax-related issues or liabilities arising from users' ownership
                or occupation of properties listed on our website.
