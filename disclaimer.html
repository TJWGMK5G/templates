                PartyDreams aims to deliver high-quality event planning services
                tailored to your needs. However, we cannot guarantee that every
                aspect of your event will proceed exactly as planned due to
                factors beyond our control. Unforeseen circumstances, such as
                vendor issues or weather conditions, may impact the outcome of
                your event. We will make every effort to address any issues

                Our services may involve working with third-party vendors and

                review any agreements or contracts with third parties
                thoroughly. Any disputes or problems with third-party vendors
                should be resolved directly with them. PartyDreams is not liable
                for any service failures or disputes related to third-party
                providers.
