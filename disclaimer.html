                Fantasy cricket is a subjective game that involves strategic
                decision-making and prediction based on various factors. The
                outcome of fantasy leagues and contests on CricketHub is
                determined by multiple variables, including player performance,
                team selection, and match dynamics.

                Users should be aware that participating in fantasy cricket on
                CricketHub involves a risk of financial loss. While winning
