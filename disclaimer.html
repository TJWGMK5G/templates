                HighStakes, its affiliates, officers, directors, employees,
                agents, suppliers, or licensors shall not be liable for any
                direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or
                exemplary damages, including but not limited to, damages for
                loss of profits, goodwill, use, data, or other intangible losses
                arising out of or in connection with your use of our website or
                services. This limitation of liability applies whether the
                alleged liability is based on contract, tort, negligence, strict
                liability, or any other basis, even if HighStakes has been
                advised of the possibility of such damages. In jurisdictions
                where the exclusion or limitation of liability for consequential
                or incidental damages is not allowed, HighStakes' liability is
                limited to the maximum extent permitted by law. HighStakes does
                not endorse, warrant, or guarantee any third-party products or
                services advertised or promoted on our website. Any transactions
                you engage in with third parties are solely between you and the
                third party, and we are not responsible for any disputes or
                issues arising from such transactions. Our liability shall be
                limited to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.

                purposes only. We do not endorse, guarantee, or assume
                responsibility for the accuracy, completeness, or legality of

                fees, arising out of or related to your use or misuse of our

                of any intellectual property or other rights of any person or
                entity. HighStakes reserves the right, at its own expense, to
                assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise
                subject to indemnification by you, in which event you will
                cooperate with HighStakes in asserting any available defenses.
                This indemnity provision shall survive the termination of these

                of those changes. If you do not agree to any changes to this

                checkpoints to satisfy your particular requirements for
                antivirus protection and accuracy of data input and output.
                HighStakes does not guarantee the availability of our website or
                services at all times. We may suspend access to our website
                temporarily or permanently without notice. We are not liable for
                any loss or damage caused by such suspension or unavailability
                of our website.

                All rights not expressly granted in this disclaimer are reserved
                by HighStakes. We reserve the right to take any action we deem
                necessary to enforce this disclaimer. Failure by HighStakes to
                enforce any provision of this disclaimer shall not constitute a
                waiver of such provision or any other provision. If any
                provision of this disclaimer is found to be invalid or
                unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall continue to be
                valid and enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by law.
                This disclaimer constitutes the entire agreement between you and
                HighStakes regarding your use of our website and services,
                superseding any prior agreements or understandings.

              <li>
                This disclaimer and your use of HighStakes' website and services
                shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws,
                without regard to its conflict of law principles. Any legal
                action or proceeding arising out of or related to this
                disclaimer or your use of our website shall be brought
                exclusively in the courts. You agree to submit to the personal
                jurisdiction of such courts and waive any objection to the venue
                of any such legal action or proceeding in such courts. If any
                provision of this disclaimer is found by a court of competent
                jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable, the parties
                nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect
                to the parties' intentions as reflected in the provision, and
                the other provisions of this disclaimer remain in full force and
                effect. HighStakes' failure to enforce any right or provision of
                this disclaimer shall not constitute a waiver of such right or
                provision.
              </li>

              <li>
                HighStakes reserves the right to modify, suspend, or discontinue
                any aspect of our website or services at any time without prior
                notice. We may add or remove features, functionalities, or
                content from our website as we see fit. We are not liable to you
                or any third party for any modification, suspension, or
                discontinuation of our website or services. We may also impose
                limits on certain features or restrict access to parts of our
                website without notice or liability. Your continued use of our
                website after such changes constitutes acceptance of the updated
                terms and conditions.

              <li>
                To the fullest extent permitted by law, HighStakes disclaims all
                warranties, express or implied, including but not limited to
                warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose,
                and non-infringement of proprietary rights. HighStakes does not
                warrant that our website will operate error-free or that our
                website and its servers are free of computer viruses or other
                harmful mechanisms. We make no warranties regarding the
                accuracy, completeness, reliability, or timeliness of any
                content available on our website. Any reliance you place on such
                content is strictly at your own risk. HighStakes makes no
                representations or warranties regarding the use, validity,
                accuracy, or reliability of the materials on our website or any
                sites linked to our website.
              </li>

              <li>
                In no event shall HighStakes, its affiliates, officers,
                directors, employees, agents, suppliers, or licensors be liable
                for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or
                punitive damages, including but not limited to damages for loss
                of profits, goodwill, use, data, or other intangible losses,
                arising out of or in connection with your use of our website or
                services. This limitation of liability applies whether the
                alleged liability is based on contract, tort, negligence, strict
                liability, or any other basis, even if HighStakes has been
                advised of the possibility of such damages. If you are
                dissatisfied with any portion of our website, or with any of
                these terms of use, your sole and exclusive remedy is to
                discontinue using our website. Some jurisdictions do not allow
                the exclusion or limitation of liability for consequential or
                incidental damages, so the above limitation may not apply to
                you. HighStakes' total liability to you for any claim arising
                out of or related to our website or services shall not exceed
                the amount paid by you, if any, to HighStakes for the use of our
                website or services.
