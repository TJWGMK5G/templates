                involves financial risks. Players may lose money through entry
                fees, bets, or other financial transactions associated with

                Game of Skill: Fantasy cricket on StumpSaga is considered a game
                of skill, where participants use their knowledge of cricket and
                strategic abilities to create teams and compete. Success is
                based on the performance of chosen players in real-life matches.
